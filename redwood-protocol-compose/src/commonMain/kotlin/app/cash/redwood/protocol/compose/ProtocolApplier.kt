 * differentiate between these children lists we introduce synthetic nodes. Every real node which
 * supports one or more groups of children will have one or more of these synthetic nodes as its
 * direct descendants. The nodes which are produced by each group of children will then become the
 * descendants of those synthetic nodes.

/**
 * An [Applier] which records operations on the tree as models which can then be separately applied
 * by the display layer. Additionally, it has special handling for emulating nodes which contain
 * multiple children.
 *
 * Nodes in the tree are required to alternate between [DiffProducingChildrenWidget] instances
 * and non-[DiffProducingChildrenWidget] [AbstractDiffProducingWidget] subtypes starting
 * from the root. This invariant is maintained by virtue of the fact that all of the input
 * `@Composables` should be generated code.
 *
 * For example, a node tree may look like this:
 * ```
 *                    Children(tag=1)
 *                     /          \
 *                    /            \
 *            ToolbarNode        ListNode
 *             /     \                 \
 *            /       \                 \
 * Children(tag=1)  Children(tag=2)   Children(tag=1)
 *        |              |               /       \
 *        |              |              /         \
 *   ButtonNode     ButtonNode     TextNode     TextNode
 * ```
 * But the protocol diff output would only record non-[DiffProducingChildrenWidget] nodes using
 * their [DiffProducingChildrenWidget.tag] value:
 * ```
 * Insert(id=<root-id>, tag=1, type=<toolbar-type>, childId=<toolbar-id>)
 * Insert(id=<toolbar-id>, tag=1, type=<button-type>, childId=..)
 * Insert(id=<toolbar-id>, tag=2, type=<button-type>, childId=..)
 * Insert(id=<root-id>, tag=1, type=<list-type>, childId=<list-id>)
 * Insert(id=<list-id>, tag=1, type=<text-type>, childId=..)
 * Insert(id=<list-id>, tag=1, type=<text-type>, childId=..)
 * ```
