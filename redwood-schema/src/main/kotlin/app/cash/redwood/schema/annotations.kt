 * ```
 * @Modifier(1, RowScope::class)
 * data class RowAlignment(
 *   val value: VerticalAlignment,
 * )

 *
 * When a modifier is applied to a widget it will be processed in one of two ways:
 * 1. If scoped, the parent widget which provides the scope will query the value. For example,
 *    each implementation of a `Row` will handle `HorizontalAlignment` set on its children.
 * 2. If unscoped, the widget factory interface will expose callback functions that are invoked
 *    when a value is used. For example, a `BackgroundColor(value: V, modifier: BackgroundColor)`
 *    function will be generated on the widget factory for each implementation to provide. The
 *    implementation should be idempotent, as it will be invoked each time a new modifier chain is
 *    set, even if the specific unscoped modifier has not changed.
