/**
 * An [Applier] which records operations on the tree as models which can then be separately applied

 * multiple children.
 *
 * Nodes in the tree are required to alternate between [ProtocolChildrenNode] instances and
 * non-[ProtocolChildrenNode] [ProtocolNode] subtypes starting from the root. This invariant is
 * maintained by virtue of the fact that all of the input `@Composables` should be generated code.
 *
 * For example, a node tree may look like this:
 * ```
 *                    Children(tag=1)
 *                     /          \
 *                    /            \
 *            ToolbarNode        ListNode
 *             /     \                 \
 *            /       \                 \
 * Children(tag=1)  Children(tag=2)   Children(tag=1)
 *        |              |               /       \
 *        |              |              /         \
 *   ButtonNode     ButtonNode     TextNode     TextNode
 * ```
 * But the protocol diff output would only record non-[ProtocolChildrenNode] nodes using their
 * [ProtocolChildrenNode.tag] value:
 * ```
 * Insert(id=<root-id>, tag=1, type=<toolbar-type>, childId=<toolbar-id>)
 * Insert(id=<toolbar-id>, tag=1, type=<button-type>, childId=..)
 * Insert(id=<toolbar-id>, tag=2, type=<button-type>, childId=..)
 * Insert(id=<root-id>, tag=1, type=<list-type>, childId=<list-id>)
 * Insert(id=<list-id>, tag=1, type=<text-type>, childId=..)
 * Insert(id=<list-id>, tag=1, type=<text-type>, childId=..)
 * ```
