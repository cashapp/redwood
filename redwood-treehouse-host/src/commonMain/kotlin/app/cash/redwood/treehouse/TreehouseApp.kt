/**
 * Manages the [Zipline] runtimes that run the code to power on-screen views.
 *
 * This takes care to launch a [Zipline] when it is requested and available.
 *
 *  * **Requested:** The runtime is started either explicitly via a call to [start], or implicitly
 *    by calling binding creating content to a UI.
 *
 *  * **Available:** The runtime is available when its code is ready, either via a download,
 *    embedded in the host application, or through the cache from an earlier execution.
 *
 * If new code is available during execution (typically during development), this will perform a
 * hot reload: gracefully stopping the current Zipline and starting its successor. It also
 * implements restarting the Zipline after an uncaught exception (in both development and
 * production).
 *
 * It is rarely necessary to call the [start], [stop], and [restart] methods directly. Calling
 * [createContent] will trigger a start automatically. Use [close] to permanently stop the Zipline.
