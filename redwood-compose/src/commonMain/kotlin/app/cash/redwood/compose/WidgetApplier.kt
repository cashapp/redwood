/**
 * An [Applier] for Redwood's tree of nodes.
 *
 * This applier has special handling for emulating widgets which contain multiple children.
 * Nodes in the tree are required to alternate between [WidgetNode] and [ChildrenNode] starting
 * from the root. This invariant is maintained by virtue of the fact that all of the input
 * `@Composable`s should bottom out in generated Redwood code.
 *
 * For example, a widget tree may look like this:
 * ```
 *                        ChildrenNode(root)
 *                          /           \
 *                         /             \
 *          WidgetNode<Toolbar>       WidgetNode<List>
 *             /          \                      \
 *            /            \                      \
 * ChildrenNode(tag=1)  ChildrenNode(tag=2)     ChildrenNode(tag=1)
 *        |                   |                      /       \
 *        |                   |                     /         \
 * WidgetNode<Button>  WidgetNode<Button>  WidgetNode<Text>  WidgetNode<Text>
 * ```
 * The node tree produced by this applier is not actually a tree. We do not maintain a relationship
 * from each [WidgetNode] to their [ChildrenNode]s as they can never be individually moved/removed.
 * Compose maintains that relationship internally to support positioning the applier.

/**
 * A synthetic widget which allows the applier to differentiate between multiple groups of children.
 *
 * Compose's tree assumes each node only has single list of children. Or, put another way, even if
 * you apply multiple children Compose treats them as a single list of child nodes. In order to
 * differentiate between these children lists we introduce synthetic nodes. Every real node which
 * supports one or more groups of children will have one or more of these synthetic nodes as its
 * direct descendants. The nodes which are produced by each group of children will then become the
 * descendants of those synthetic nodes.
 *
 * This node has two valid states:
 * 1. Non-null accessor and null children. This is the state when created but not inserted in
 *    the node tree.
 * 2. Null accessor and non-null children. Once inserted into the tree, the accessor is used to
 *    fetch the appropriate children reference from the parent widget.
 *
 * Transition from 1 to 2 by calling [attachTo]. This may only be done once, and you
 * cannot transition back to 1 afterwards.
